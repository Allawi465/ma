            I am a graduate of Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. I
            love coding, and the challenges it presents me with. I use a lot of
            my spare time programming in different languages, working towards
            evolving my knowledge and skills. I thrive to expand my experience
            and hope to eventually be able to work as a full stack developer.

                In my regular day, I primarily use React and Next.js for
                building dynamic and interactive web applications. I also have
                experience with Figma for designing user interfaces and graphic
                design tasks. Recently, I've started exploring libraries like
                Anime.js and Three.js to add animations and 3D graphics to my
                projects.
